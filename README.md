👋 **Hi there! I'm Md Asif Bin Syed**, a Sr. Supply Chain Data Analyst at The Home Depot, the world's leading home improvement retailer. With over 5+ years of experience, I transform business challenges into production-grade ML and AI solutions, delivering measurable impact including **$30M+ in cost savings** and improved model accuracy by **8-10%** across multiple projects. Leading the development of offline reinforcement learning agents that reduce delivery failures by **8.5% ($10M retained revenue)** and building ML models for operational forecasting using modern frameworks like **LangGraph** and **ADK**.

I am a researcher specializing in **reinforcement learning**, **generative AI**, and **deep learning** across domains such as marine surveillance, medical diagnosis, supply chain optimization, and time series forecasting. Currently pursuing an **MS in Computer Science** with a specialization in **Machine Learning** at Georgia Institute of Technology.

I have published in venues including **ICML Workshop'25**, **NeurIPS Workshop'25**, **IEEE conferences, with contributions in time series foundation models, diversity quantification, and physics-informed neural networks**. My work focuses on building production-grade ML systems that solve real-world business problems while advancing the state-of-the-art in machine learning research.
